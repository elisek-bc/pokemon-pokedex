# Pokédex Exercise
For this exercise I tried to create a Pokédex using vanilla Javascript. Maybe later on I'll get the time to convert it to Vue or React. You can see the finished project [here](https://www.google.be).

## Timing
I started this voluntary on 2 September 2019, during my 7-month training at BeCode. I would like to finish the exercise before 4 September 2019.

## Contributors
I, Elise, am the only contributor to this project.
